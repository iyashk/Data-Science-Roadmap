## Project 1 - A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones
This is a project from the datacamp.com in which i have to analyze the network of characters in Game of Thrones and how it changes over the course of the books.

### Description of the Project :
The purpose of this project is to examine the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over five books of R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire (also known as Game of Thrones). Using different centrality measures, we will examine how the importance of the characters changes over the course of the books.

### Project tasks :
1. Winter is Coming. Let's load the dataset ASAP!
2. Time for some Network of Thrones
3. Populate the network with the DataFrame
4. The most important character in Game of Thrones
5. The evolution of character importance
6. What's up with Stannis Baratheon?
7. What does Google PageRank tell us about GoT?
8. Correlation between different measures
9. Conclusion

## Project 2 - Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
This project is also from datacamp.com that icluded handling and analysis of the data. This allowed me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots that I created for the data. 

### Project Description :
The main theme behind this project is to discover that if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from pandas and matplotlib.

### Project Tasks :

1. Loading your friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
